<p>The dream of becoming a homeowner is one that many Filipinos strive hard to achieve. In fact, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA),&nbsp;<a href="https://psa.gov.ph/content/housing-characteristics-philippines-results-2015-census-population" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24.22 million housing units</a> have been established and occupied in the country as of 2015. But not all of these homes are owned by their occupants. The same report indicates that 55.3 percent, or just over half, of Filipinos own their housing unit and lot. The rest are in various situations of renting or partial ownership.</p>
<p>As the population of the Philippines grows, so does the demand for a mode of housing which is conducive for the lifestyle of the people that it shelters. For some buyers, a ready-made unit is the way to go, saving them from the hassle of construction and moving straight to occupancy. But for those who have the notion of a “dream” home, life is not as easy as simply cashing in on a house of their fancy. With every dream comes the costs of what it takes to turn it into reality. And in this day and age, it is important to keep in mind that high quality does not come at a low cost.</p>
<p>Navigate the ins and outs of building the house of your fantasies in this modern age. Before striking that deal, be sure to educate yourself about the things that affect home prices.</p>
<h3><strong>Supply and demand</strong></h3>
<p>It’s basic economics. When the amount of people looking for a house is greater than the number of available units for consumption, then the price goes up.</p>

<p>In 2016, the housing backlog was estimated at <a href="https://www.lamudi.com.ph/whitepaper-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5.7 million</a>. According to CEO of housing developer Hausland and Fiesta Communities and former president of the Organization of Socialized Housing Developers of the Philippines Atty. Christopher Ryan Tan, it will reach <a href="https://www.lamudi.com.ph/outlook-real-estate-market-trends-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.67 million by 2022</a>. This is because only about 168,000 to 190,000 housing units have been built every year for the past five years.</p>
<p>In order to meet the demand for housing, the public and private sector would have to find a way to produce more low-cost (Php1.7 million to Php3 million), economic (Php450,000 to Php1.7 million), and socialized (lower than Php450,000) housing units. Until then, expect prices to be higher than usual, especially if looking for housing in highly saturated parts of Metro Manila and even in the fringes of the metropolis.</p>
<h3><strong>Dwelling type</strong></h3>
<p>The type of home still largely depends on the lifestyle of the people who will reside in it. Whether it is a simple bungalow-type or a house with an elegant finish, design will reflect greatly on the cost.</p>

<p>If you are living large with a high-maintenance lifestyle, <a href="http://www.lamudi.com.ph/journal/qa-how-much-money-do-i-need-to-build-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detached houses and high-end residences tend to hit prices between P53,900/sqm and P63,150/sqm</a>. Aside from just the cost of construction, however, a large portion of the price will be taken up by the fee for the architect who will be designing your new home.</p>
<p>However, among all types of residential constructions built during the past year, single-type houses gained the most number of projects, comprising 85.7 percent of the total. On average, the cost of single-type houses reached Php9,087/sqm.</p>
<h3><strong>Size</strong></h3>
<p>As of the last quarter of 2017, the housing index in the Philippines has boosted to 10,777 pesos per square meter from just P9,579/sqm in the third quarter of last year. According to think tank <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/philippines/housing-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trading Economics</a>, housing index does not only take into consideration the size of a house but the specifics of electrical, mechanical, and plumbing as well, among many other factors.</p>

<p>In construction, the height of a structure greatly affects the price. A higher building necessitates a stronger foundation, therefore more materials and labor are needed. The greater the floor and ceiling height, the more that a home looks gallant and spacious. Since a taller house would also mean more wall finishes and material for sturdiness, its impact on the cost will be great.</p>
<p>Standard houses with one to two bedrooms and those with terraces tend to cost around P31,000/sqm and P25,700/sqm, respectively, according to construction consultancy services provider Langdon &amp; Seah Philippines Inc.</p>
<h3><strong>Location and accessibility</strong></h3>
<p>In the Philippines, location is one of the major determining factors of housing prices. According to data by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) in June 2016, housing prices continue to rise in the National Capital Region (NCR).</p>
<p>While the trend changes drastically every now and then during the years since then, the fourth quarter of 2017 saw a double-digit surge in duplex and condominium prices nationwide—5.7 percent year-on-year to be exact, according to a report from <a href="http://bworldonline.com/q4-home-price-hike-biggest-in-three-quarters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business World</a><span id="ssfwdtxqedxdterrrvfevfvtbuzyzr"><a rel="file" style="display: none;" href="dqbyrtxyryfewtwdsas.html">yfcbszwdfrzuwztdqdf</a></span>.</p>

<p>If you have set your sights on building a home in Manila, the cost of doing so does not come cheap. According to central bank data, prices in Metro Manila shot up to 8.8 percent in the past year while provinces increased by only an average of three percent.</p>
<p>However, for those looking for a place to settle away from the bustle of the city, provinces near Manila remain to be top choices. Cavite, Batangas, Laguna, and Pampanga are ideal places for your place of residence as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, if your lot location is significantly lower than the road, this would require the land to be filled in, entailing additional costs.</p>
<h3><strong>Construction time</strong></h3>
<p>Rushed construction usually requires more labor, meaning more costs for the buyer. Still, the cost of the labor-intensive construction and shortened timetable should be the least of your worries as compromising the quality of your home is the biggest danger at hand.</p>

<p>However, much of the process behind building a home still rests on the shoulders of the client. While demand, type, size, location, and timetable are factors which affect your budget, it is also pretty common for people to firmly set a budget before other considerations.</p>
<p>With a specific amount in mind, it is good to practice pragmatism when it comes to building the home of your dreams. Inform your prospective architect and contractor about your budget, get the necessary arrangements done, and you’ll find yourself easing through to the construction phase in no time at all.</p>
